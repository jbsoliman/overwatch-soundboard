# overwatch-soundboard

The application is based around the video game Overwatch, which includes 21 characters from various backgrounds.
It includes information of each character, as well as a soundboard that includes audio clips from the characters in the game.
All sound data is saved in the app, which means that offline use is a option when it comes to the soundboard.
Users also have the option to register an account, and use that account to hold “favorite” characters that can be quickly accessed.
